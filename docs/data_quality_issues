# 1. Missing Values

customer_name: Multiple rows are blank (e.g., rows with order_id like ORD-2024-09537, ORD-2023-10100).

region: Some rows have missing or incomplete values (e.g., empty, Nrth, Est, Sout, Wst).

sales_cycle_days: Many rows have missing values (e.g., ORD-2022-07170, ORD-2022-07424).

discount_percent: Some rows are blank but discount_amount may be present, or vice versa (e.g., ORD-2022-05024).

quantity: Some quantities are negative (e.g., -4, -10, -32), which may indicate returns or errors.

status: Mostly consistent, but some are Pending or Cancelled while others are COMPLETED (uppercase variations).


# 2. Inconsistent Formatting

## Dates:

Mixed formats (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YY). Some use - as separator, others /. Some are invalid (e.g., 19/10/2022 vs. 24/06/2022).

## Currency/Numbers:

unit_price has inconsistent formatting: some with $, some with commas, some with extra spaces (e.g., "$1,707.82 ").

Some numeric fields have trailing/leading spaces.

## Text Fields:

customer_name sometimes includes quotes and commas (e.g., "Holmes, Williams and Wright").

product_name has inconsistent spacing and naming (e.g., " Standing Desk ", "monitor 27""", "laptop pro", "conference table").

status has mixed case (Completed, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, Cancelled, Pending).

## Region Values:

Abbreviations like Nrth, Est, Sout, Wst instead of North, East, South, West.

Some are completely blank.



# 3. Duplicates
There may be duplicate order IDs, but visually scanning shows unique order_id values. However, some transactions may be duplicates in content (same customer, date, amount) but with different IDs.

Data Entry Duplication:
Example: ORD-2023-03785 appears twice in the dataset with identical details (Hernandez PLC, Notebook Pack, etc.).



# 4. Outliers & Anomalies
Negative Quantities:
Examples: -4, -10, -32. These could be returns or data entry errors.

Extreme Prices:
Some unit_price values seem abnormally high or low (e.g., $2,455.94 for a monitor vs. $11.27 for a stapler). Need business validation.

Large Quantities:
Example: quantity = 50 for a monitor, quantity = 44 for an office chair.

Discounts > 100% or Negative:
Some discount_percent values are high (e.g., 20% is fine, but check logic if subtotal and total_amount don’t align).

total_amount vs Calculated Value:
In some rows, total_amount ≠ subtotal - discount_amount (e.g., rounding errors or missing tax logic).

sales_cycle_days:
Some are 0 or very high (e.g., 90 days). Could be valid or data entry errors.



# 5. Structural & Logical Issues
Mismatched Calculations:
Some rows show discount_amount but discount_percent is blank or zero.

subtotal ≠ quantity * unit_price:
In some rows, the math doesn’t match due to formatting or rounding.

category vs product_name Mismatch:
Example: "standing desk" under Furniture is fine, but naming inconsistencies may cause grouping issues.

Invalid Regions:
Nrth, Est, etc., are not standard values.



# 6. Data Entry Errors
Typos in Sales Rep Names:
Example: "Jeffrey Lawrence" vs "Jeffery Wagner" (different people, but check for consistency).

Product Name Variations:
"Keyboard Elite" vs " Keyboard Elite " vs "keyboard elite".

Date Errors:
Some dates may be invalid (e.g., 31/02/2023).
